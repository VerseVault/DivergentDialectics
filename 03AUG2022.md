Time crystals and temporal turbulances are exciting fields of exploration. However time is becoming so truncated and tesselated so that it becomes immaterial in our spacial and semantic computations. Perhaps it becomes allegorical to the postulates of calculus where we evaluate the functions by pushing them to the limits of time. Time tending to zero; time tending to infinity. These are the extreme conditions of calculations in the calculus sense. 

When our space becomes multi dimensional manifold due to interpellations and interruptions of real, surreal and virtual realities, where is the scope for time traversals? When our experiences become condensed and covariant,  conjugal and complex, it becomes very difficut to qualify and quantify time beyond the arithmetical measures.
