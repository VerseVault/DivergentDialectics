- There is a journey of meanings
- From countless to countables
- From abstract to allegories
- From algorithms to archetypes
  
- There are myths of moorings
- From colorless to colorful
- From oddities to occidents

- Words, wise and whimsical
- Waking up in a whirlpool

- A flat fathomless eye
- Spreading like a serpent
- Aimless like a kite
- Traceless like an ellipsis

- An abode of a reckless rodent
- Withering like a white noise
- Spinning like a wrecked wheel

- I am weaving a tesselation
- I am beaming in a bizmuth
- Absorbing achives of aperture
