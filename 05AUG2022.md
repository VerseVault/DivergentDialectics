A Critical Review of Internet Infrastructure

Internet and world wide web are two constructions of humanity that changed the human life and social business like never before. From its early days of inception, internet was never designed to be trustless and transparent. It was creating islands of communication and computation. However a few people created search eingines and social networks for connecting people and institutions. It is a bit ironic to think of communication systems without openness. We created so many protocols and products to shield information in communication systems. Perhaps it is necessary when you think about communication among unknown participants. 

Projects like wikipedia are completely different than the rest of the information systems that exist on world wide web.
