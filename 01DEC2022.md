In the void of volumes
Digits can feel decades
Mind can measure matter
Leaving ellipsis for cryptics 

When truth is episoidal 
Divergence is real
Dichotomy is near
Dissection is dear

Time freezes itself
Time is a metric
Time is a feeling
Time opens up itself
To the multitude of mutations

At times future begins to question 
The currents of context
Through the optics of past 

At times everything is distroted
Even waves begin to wave off

Between the words of worth
The logic of silence spins off
