- There is no theory to gauge the gazes. It is just a topic of interest. Perhaps it is a trivial topic. I feel it is biomechanical in nature. Perhpaps it is connected to cognitive psychology. Gazes stir up emotions. Gazes extract emotions. Gazes deduce emotions. Gazes connects people in a lucid manner. It is like an invisble knot between people. There are different kind of gazes. Some look for depths, some are shallow, some look for shades. Some other are hovering in between. Human vision is structured so selflessly. It circles around the gravity of light. It is tangential to the contours of every color. However, human perspectives are so different. 

- Gazes are the theme once again. Gravity of a gaze, it is a dimension in itself. Colors are other kind of materials that deciphers and decodes a lot of meanings from our experiences, expressions and emotions. It is important to decode the meaning from these ensembles. When you are surrounded by your own thoughts, your gaze becomes divergent and dialectic in nature. Is divergence a necessary attribute of dialectics? I think so. Dialectic entities will always demonstrate divergence in dynamic processes. Gazes are always directed to the colors. Colors create contours and coils of character infront of a gaze.
