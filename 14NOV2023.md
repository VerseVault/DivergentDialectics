Every web of life
Has a mesh in its edges
Some of them are born sentient
With no sense of prime

Every web of life
Has a void in its center
Some of them are born savage
With all senses of prime

These meshes are dense
These voids are tense
They fail to fold
They fail to fickle
They fail to figment
They just evolve
They must evolve

In the proximities of prime
In the cardinals of chaos
They nonce each other
They maze each other
