Every web of life
Has a mesh in its edges
Some of them are born sentient
With no sense of prime

Every web of life
Has a void in its center
Some of them are born savage
With all senses of prime

These meshes are dense
These voids are tense

They fail to fold
They fail to fickle
They fail to figment

They just evolve
They must evolve

In the proximities of prime
In the cardinals of chaos

They nonce each other
They maze each other

Only to rivet in random centroids
Only to resonate in relentless randomness

This poem is inspired by a view that the life has intricate webs with a definte geometry. It has beings distributed in its center, peripheries, tangents and in between. It is ironic that the people living in the edges of this web are the sentient beings. The people flummoxed at its center turn out to be savage. Both the meshes and voids are full of activities and hence it can be termed dense and tense. Despite the divergence in their affinity and gravity, both the beings in the center and tangents turn out to be irregular as they fail to fold, fickle and figment. Even when there is a chaos, both of these beings help us to preserve the cardinality of life.
